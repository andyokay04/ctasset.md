# What is a ctASSET, and Why It Matters in DeFi

## A **ctASSET** is a **yield-bearing receipt token** you receive when depositing into a Concrete vault.  
It’s more than just proof of deposit—it’s your gateway to active, composable DeFi strategies.

## Where ctASSETs Come From
Here’s the flow in plain terms:

1. Deposit an asset into a Concrete vault (e.g., USDC, WBTC, USDT).  
2. The vault issues a **ctASSET** (e.g., ctUSDC, ctWBTC, ctUSDT).  
3. The ctASSET represents **your share of the vault**, including yield and incentives.

> Think of it as a single token representing your capital at work across multiple strategies.

# Why ctASSETs Are Important
Unlike traditional vault shares that just sit idle, ctASSETs are **programmable, liquid, and composable**.  

- **Automatic yield** – compounds without manual effort  
- **Value growth** – increases as the vault generates returns  
- Represents **active DeFi strategies**, not idle deposits  
- Turns **idle capital into active capital** usable across ecosystems  

> ctASSETs are a new primitive in DeFi—a “money lego” you can stack, route, and compose.

## Use Cases for ctASSET
ctASSETs are designed to **move and interact**. Some key use cases:

- **Hold and earn yield** – your vault position keeps compounding automatically  
- **Trade or swap** – fully liquid and interoperable  
- **Provide liquidity** – in AMMs or lending platforms  
- **Collateralize or leverage** – borrow or amplify positions  
- **Power new strategies or structured products** – integrate into DeFi apps or cross-chain ecosystems  

> Every ctASSET is modular, portable, and composable, letting your capital do more than ever.
