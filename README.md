# What Is a ctASSET, and Why Does It Matter in DeFi?

DeFi has introduced powerful ways to earn yield, but for many users it still feels complex and fragmented. Concrete aims to simplify this experience, and one of its core building blocks is the **ctASSET**.

## What Is a ctASSET?

A **ctASSET is a yield-bearing receipt token you receive when depositing into a Concrete vault**.

Instead of assets sitting idle, a ctASSET represents a position that actively earns yield on your behalf. As long as you hold it, your capital continues to work through strategies managed by Concrete.

## Where Do ctASSETs Come From?

The flow is intentionally simple and beginner-friendly:

- A user deposits assets into a **Concrete vault**
- The vault issues a corresponding **ctASSET**, such as `ctWBTC`, `ctsEIGEN`, or `ctUSD`
- The ctASSET represents your share of the vault along with the yield it earns

As the vault generates returns, the value of the ctASSET increases automatically, without requiring any manual actions from the user.

## Why Do ctASSETs Matter?

ctASSETs are more than basic deposit receipts.

- They earn yield automatically
- They can increase in value over time as the vault earns
- They represent active DeFi strategies, not idle deposits
- They turn passive capital into productive capital

This makes DeFi more accessible, especially for users who want exposure to yield without managing multiple protocols or strategies.

## What Can You Do With a ctASSET?

Holding a ctASSET gives users flexibility across DeFi:

- Hold and earn yield over time
- Trade or swap to adjust exposure
- Use as liquidity in DeFi pools
- Use as collateral or leverage
- Support future structured DeFi products

A single ctASSET can unlock multiple use cases.

## ctASSETs and One-Click DeFi

ctASSETs are a key part of Concrete’s **One-Click DeFi** vision:

- One deposit results in one ctASSET
- No need to manage multiple positions
- No manual compounding
- No strategy switching

Everything happens behind the scenes, while users hold a single, yield-bearing asset.
